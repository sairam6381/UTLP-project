# UTLP-project (reverse turing test - CAPTCHA)

ABSTRACT :

    Alan Turing in 1950,proposed that the computer can be said to possess artificial intelligence if it can mimic human responses under
    specific conditions. In reverse Turing system, the questioner asks a series of questions to both respondents. After the specified 
    time the questioner tries to decide which terminal is operated by the human and the machine. 
    
WORKING :

    * The GLCD, Graphical Liquid  Crystal Display is used to display colours based on the number of GLCD chipsets.
    * The resolution is 240 X 320 and the GLCD is split into 3 x 3 grid with nine different colours.
    * The program is written to display nine colours with their corresponding hexadecimal codes.
    * Examples : BLACK-0x000000, WHITE-0xFFFFFF.
    * The LCD, Liquid Crystal Display is used to display the message(colour).
    * The user is asked to touch the relevant colour displayed in the LCD panel.
    * If the user touches the same colour then it will display-YOU ARE A HUMAN else â€“ YOU ARE A ROBOT.
    
PROCEDURE :
    
    * After completing your code and done making your file
    * Turn on your UTLK kit and connect it with your pc using ulk control panel
    * After connecting load the bin file of your project and run it
